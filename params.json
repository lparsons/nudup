{"name":"nudup","tagline":"NuGEN Technology's tool for deduplicating reads using N6 sequence information ","body":"![](http://nugendata.com/images/nugen_logo_noedge.png)  \r\n[www.nugen.com](http://www.nugen.com)\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n-----------------------------\r\n- samtools-0.1.18 or higher [samtools page](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) Tested on 0.1.18\r\n- python2.7 [anaconda page](http://continuum.io/downloads) Tested on 2.7.7 \r\n- GNU-coreutils gzip,sed,cut,grep etc. Standard on Ubuntu 12.04+.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----------------------------\r\nRun `python nudup.py -h` for latest usage.\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: nudup.py [-2] [-f INDEX.fq|READ.fq] [-o OUT_PREFIX] [-s START]\r\n                [-l LENGTH] [-v] [-h]\r\n                IN.sam|IN.bam\r\n\r\nMarks/removes PCR duplicates using the N6 sequence technology used in\r\nNuGEN's Ovation Target Enrichment libraries.\r\n\r\nFor single end reads, duplicates are marked if they fulfill the following\r\ncriteria: a) start in the same location b) have the same orientation/strand\r\nc) have the same N6 sequence. The read with the highest mapping quality is kept\r\nas the non-duplicate read. For paired end reads, duplicates are marked if they\r\nfulfill the following criteria: a) start in the same location b) have the same\r\ntemplate length c) have the same N6 sequence. The read pair with the highest\r\nmapping quality is kept as the non-duplicate read.\r\n\r\nThe runtime for marking and removal of duplicates depends on the format of the\r\ninputs. Here are the two cases for running this tool:\r\n\r\n- Case 1 (faster runtime): User supplies pre-built SAM/BAM alignment file that\r\n  is sorted and has fixed length N6 sequence appended to the read name\r\n- Case 2 (slower runtime): User supplies SAM/BAM alignment file and FASTQ file\r\n  containing N6 sequence. SAM/BAM records do not have a N6 sequence, but the N6\r\n  sequence is a substring in the read or title of the FASTQ file. FASTQ read\r\n  names must be unique, and each SAM/BAM record must have corresponding read\r\n  name in the FASTQ file.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Anand Patel\r\nContact: NuGEN Technologies Inc., techserv@nugen.com\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n  IN.sam|IN.bam         input sorted/unsorted SAM/BAM\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -2, --paired-end      use paired end deduping with template.
